<li class="text-xl font-bold">History of Tanah Lot Temple </li>

Tanah Lot Temple has a rich history dating back to the 16th century. It was built by a Hindu priest named Dang Hyang Nirartha. According to legend, he used his spiritual powers to ward off sea snakes that used to disturb the local fishermen. The rocky outcrop where the temple stands was believed to be the dwelling place of the fearful sea snakes. Hence, the temple was named "Tanah Lot," which means "land in the sea" in the Balinese language.
